# Rock, Paper Scissor Game

Rock, paper, scissor game against the computer created in Javascript.

## Motivation

This part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) foundations course. After learning the basics of Javascript, I'll implement a simple game to put into practice what I've learnt and improve my skills/knowledge further.

## How to Play

1. Go to [Rock, Paper, Scissors Game](https://jofortunato.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/);
2. In your browser, open the console (for Google Chrome hit Ctrl+Shift+J);
3. Type: game();
4. Follow the instuctions presented in the browser and Play!

## Development

- [x] Console based rock, paper, scissor game. Use a prompt to get the player play;
- [ ] Create a simple UI so that the player can play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
